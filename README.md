## ✨ What's New Compared to Awesome-CV

This plain version introduces the following changes for a more traditional CV style:

- 🔧 **Simplified Layout**: Removed colored highlights and graphical elements for a cleaner appearance.
- 🔤 **Font Change**: Switched to `\rmfamily` (serif font) for a more classic and professional document style.
- 🎨 **No Color Accents**: Replaced vivid color accents with monochrome styles to better suit formal job applications.
- 🛠️ **Bug Fix**: Resolved the issue in the original Awesome-CV where adding LinkedIn links with duplicate usernames resulted in unwanted numeric suffixes.
